## :pencil: Main Description

This is the final project of the React module. It consists of the creation of a monitoring application on a subject of free choice. In this case, I created an application to follow the musicians' study routines.

This application is connected to an APP developed in ReactJS. To access the APP, click [here](https://github.com/jucora/musician-tracking-app/tree/version1)
